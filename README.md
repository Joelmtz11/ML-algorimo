# Neural Network Implementation from Scratch

This project provides a basic implementation of a neural network without using external deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The purpose of this project is to understand the fundamental concepts of neural networks and backpropagation by building a simple neural network from scratch using Python and numpy.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-from-scratch.git
# ML-algorimo
Aqu√≠ hare un Modelo de Machine Learning sin uso de librerias
cd neural-network-from-scratch
python neural_network.py
Dependencies
This project relies on the following libraries:

Python 3.x
numpy
You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

neural_network.py: The main script that contains the implementation of the neural network class and demonstrates how to use it to solve a simple problem.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
Implementation Details
The neural network is implemented with the following components:

Activation Function: Sigmoid
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Backpropagation Algorithm
Adjusting the Network
You can modify the network architecture and training parameters in the neural_network.py script. Experiment with different numbers of hidden layers, nodes per layer, learning rate, and training epochs to observe their effects on the training process and performance.
